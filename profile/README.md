The [Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC)](https://www.bv-brc.org) is
an information system designed to support the biomedical research
communityâ€™s work on bacterial and viral infectious diseases via
integration of vital pathogen information with rich data and analysis
tools. BV-BRC combines the data, technology, and extensive user
communities from two long-running centers: PATRIC, the bacterial
system , and IRD/ViPR, the viral systems. In addition to hundreds
of thousands of bacterial genomes in PATRIC and over a million viral
genomes in IRD/ViPR, the two resources host data on protein structure
and function, clinical studies, drug targets and resistance,
epidemiology, and other features, and provide open source tools for
data analysis and genomic annotation.
